## A Bootstrap Starter Pack!

This collection combines Twitter Bootstrap 3.1 along with HTML5 Boilerplate. I put this together so that I can have a quick Bootstrap starter kit, that also includes the standard Bootstrap LESS files, ready for preprocessing. 

### Lesshat Baked in

Use the powerful LESS Hat mixin library to easily add new CSS values directly to your .less files.
